# Digital-Assistant

## Project Description/Scope:
We will be developing a tasks list website in order to help users complete their daily and weekly tasks.
Students will be able to input their tasks, by when it needs to be completed, and the level of importance.
Students will be able to organize their tasks with labels so it is more personalized. These labels will include, school/educational in order to include homework, projects, studying tasks. Another label will be social to include club meetings, sports, or friend hangouts. Another label will be work to schedule in job tasks and finally a label for personal to include home chores and other errands. 
Once a task is completed, a user will be able to check it off and remove it from their list. Tasks will be organized for the week and a student will be able to add a task for each day. For example we will have sections for every day of the week Monday-Sunday and on each day a student can add a task needed to be completed. A checkbox will be seen next to it so when a task is completed they simply need to check it off and it will be crossed out
Daily motivational quotes will be provided in the home page in order to motivate students to complete their tasks.

## Target User Group and Context:
College students, specifically UCI students who need help staying on top of their school tasks (homework, project,etc), and social activities such as club meetings, their work schedule, or other daily home chores/more personal tasks
